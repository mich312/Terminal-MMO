# Durst World — Graphics, Generative World & Commands Roadmap

Direction agreed with the team. Decisions locked:

- **Graphics:** truecolor + half-block "pixel" rendering, auto-detecting the
  client and downsampling to 256/16 colors.
- **Generative world:** a chunked, camera-scrolled infinite overworld.
- **AI/NPCs:** none — the world stays deterministic and fully offline.
- **Order:** rendering foundation first, then chat commands, then worldgen.

## Phase 0 — Rendering foundation ✅ (this milestone)

- Per-session, auto-detecting renderer (`bubbletea.MakeRenderer` →
  `ui.NewTheme`); truecolor palette with automatic 256/16 fallback.
- `ui.Theme` style set bound to one renderer; threaded through `game.Ctx`.
  Back-compat globals (`ui.WallStyle`, …) alias the process `ui.Default`.
- Half-block pixel layer (`Theme.HalfBlock`) + gradient/shimmer helpers
  (`Theme.Shimmer`, `Theme.VGradient`, `ui.Blend`).
- Camera/viewport (`game.Camera`, `CameraOn`, `RenderViewport`,
  `Walker.RenderViewport`) — renders a window around the player so maps can be
  larger than the screen. Prerequisite for the chunked overworld.
- Cinematic intro: animated DURST WORLD wordmark, then a smooth camera pan
  straight down onto the live play field.

## Phase 1 — Fancy graphics polish

- ✅ Real-time day/night tint cycle (`ui.Ambient`): tiles blend toward a
  time-of-day color; player glyphs stay full-bright. Tick now carries a
  monotonic `Frame` for animation.
- ✅ Animated tiles (`TileAnim`): glyph + color cycle off the frame counter.
  Kraftwerk machines pulse, coolant flows, lamps flicker; lobby plants breathe.
- ✅ Radial lighting (`Light` / `Walker.RenderLit`): tiles fade to shadow past
  the player's reach. Kraftwerk is now a dim machine hall.
- ✅ Biome palettes & climate: domain-warped elevation/moisture for organic
  biome edges, plus a temperature field (colder with altitude) that adds
  snowfields, snow-capped peaks, warm-dry savanna and wet-low swamp to the
  original water/sand/grass/forest/hill/mountain set. Each climate biome has
  its own hand-authored 6×6 HD ground texture (snow sparkle, dry savanna
  flecks, swamp mud blotches).
- ✅ Fog-of-war discovery: the Wilds starts hidden and reveals a circle around
  the player as they walk (bright sight radius + dimmed explored memory + fog
  beyond). Drives both the glyph and HD renderers and the minimap. Persisted to
  the store as 8×8 chunk bitmasks (full chunks pack to 8 bytes, frontier chunks
  keep exact bits), alongside the player's position — so the map and where you
  stand survive disconnects and re-entry.
- ⬜ Particles / weather layer.
- ⬜ Directional / two-cell avatars with a drop shadow.

## Phase 2 — Chunked infinite overworld ✅

- ✅ `internal/worldgen`: seeded, **stateless** generation — every cell is a
  pure function of `(seed, x, y)` (multi-octave value noise for elevation &
  moisture, hash-scatter for props). No stored chunks, so the world is
  infinite and identical for every session on the same seed.
- ✅ Biomes: deep/shallow water, sand, grass (flowers, tufts), forest
  (blocking trees), hills (boulders), mountain peaks. Water flows via the
  animated-tile system; day/night tint applies on top.
- ✅ `internal/areas/wilds`: keeps the player's absolute world coordinates and
  samples a player-centered window each frame, rendered through the existing
  camera/tile path. Players share one coordinate space, so presence and
  proximity chat just work.
- ✅ A home gate (`⌂`) at the origin returns to the lobby, with a compass hint
  so players are never stranded; a forced clearing guarantees a sane spawn.
  Reached from the new lobby portal `◈ The Wilds`.
- ⬜ Admin `/regen <seed>` to reroll (lands with Phase 3 commands).

## Phase 3 — Chat commands ✅

- ✅ Command registry + parser (`internal/game/commands.go`): chat starting
  with `/` routes to a handler instead of `World.Chat`. Aliases supported.
- ✅ Core commands: `/help [cmd]`, `/who`, `/where`, `/me`, `/w` (aliases
  `/whisper /tell /msg`), `/roll [NdM]`, `/color [0-7]`, `/goto <area>`,
  `/clear`. Multi-line output (`/help`, `/who`) uses a dismissable info panel.
- ✅ New world primitives: `Emote` (proximity), `Whisper` (one recipient,
  sender echoes locally), `SetColor`.
- ⬜ Admin `/regen <seed>` and `/tp`: deferred — the game has no auth (the SSH
  username is the identity, no password), so there's no admin gate yet. Needs
  an ownership/allowlist concept first, and `/regen` needs the Wilds seed to
  become shared mutable state with safe re-spawning.

## Phase 4 — Detailed avatars, Wilds hub, controls ✅

- ✅ Cell-grid renderer: the map composites into a `[]rcell` grid (glyph + fg +
  optional bg) so transparent multi-cell sprites overlay terrain correctly —
  ANSI-string overlay couldn't do partial transparency.
- ✅ Multi-tile players: a 2×2 collision footprint drawn as a larger
  Claude-inspired half-block sprite (square pixels — terminal cells aren't),
  with a "you" chevron and a name initial. Defined in `internal/game/sprite.go`.
- ✅ The Wilds is the spawn hub. Landmark portals near the origin (`⌂` HQ, `P`
  Presentation, `K` Kraftwerk, `D` Demo) lead to the hand-built areas; Durst HQ
  stays enterable. Each landmark sits in a forced clearing.
- ✅ Controls: 8-way movement (WASD/arrows + Y U B N diagonals), run on
  Shift/uppercase (2 tiles), and a minimap toggle (`m`) in the Wilds.
- ✅ Portal triggering reworked for multi-tile bodies: proximity-based with an
  "armed" latch so you can't bounce back through the portal you arrived from
  (a 2×2 body can't always stand on a wall-embedded portal tile).

## Parked polish

- ✅ Real-pixel renderer (kitty graphics / sixel): shipped as the **default**
  renderer — a plain `ssh` serves HD (sixel/kitty, auto-detected from TERM),
  `ssh -t … glyph` opts back into the half-block client. Flat + delta,
  event-driven, with the half-block renderer as the fallback. Background and
  measurements: [`docs/pixel-renderer.md`](pixel-renderer.md).
- Particles / weather layer.
- Directional facing for avatars (sprite mirrors with movement).
- Mark landmarks on the minimap distinctly.
- Admin `/regen`, `/tp` (needs an auth/ownership concept).
